                <h2>My story</h2>
                <p><span style="color:#2424c4; font-weight: bold; font-size: 1.2vw;">WHERE IT BEGINS?</span> Embarking on a journey of professional growth and transformation, my story begins during my first year pursuing a master's degree in economics. It was then that I secured my first data-related internship at iFLYTEK, a company in the speech technology industry. In this role, I undertook the crucial responsibility of preprocessing vast volumes of speech data, suporting the R&D teams in their pursuit of cutting-edge advancements. This experience ignited a deep passion for data and prompted me to chart a new career path in the realm of data science.</p>
                <p><span style="color:#2424c4; font-weight: bold; font-size: 1.2vw;">A LITTLE HICCUP</span> Motivated by this newfound love for data, I diligently pursued opportunities to expand my knowledge and skills. As a research assistant, I immersed myself in the collection, processing, and analysis of OECD pension data, further along honing my expertise in data-driven insights. However, the unforeseen challenges posed by the Covid-19 pandemic delayed my plans to pursue a second master's program at NYU.</p>
                <p><span style="color:#2424c4; font-weight: bold; font-size: 1.2vw;">A BRAND NEW START</span> Rather than being discouraged, I seized this unexpected pause in my journey as an opportunity for personal growth. During this time, I passionately delved into self-directed learning, mastering statistics and Python. By the time I enrolled in the prestigious MS in Data Science program at NYU's Center for Data Science, I had already developed fluency in leveraging Python for data processing and analysis.</p>
                <p><span style="color:#2424c4; font-weight: bold; font-size: 1.2vw;">TWO YEARS ON RAMP</span> Over the course of two transformative years, I underwent intensive training in AI/ML, while gaining invaluable research experience in the field of automatic speech recognition (ASR). This comprehensive skill set empowered me to effectively harness diverse AI/ML algorithms to solve complex problems spanning various domains.</p>
                <p><span style="color:#2424c4; font-weight: bold; font-size: 1.2vw;">WHAT'S NEXT?</span> Through my journey, I have come to recognize the immense potential of data science in addressing real-world challenges. While it may be viewed by some as an added advantage, I firmly believe that data science is an essential tool for unlocking hidden insights and driving impactful solutions. As I continue on this path, I am commited to leveraging my expertise and passion for data to make a meaningful impact in the business world.</p>
